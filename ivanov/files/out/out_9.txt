As the conversation continued, Mr. Bennett mentioned an old clock that had been in the shop for as long as he could remember. It was a tall, ornate grandfather clock with a beautifully carved wooden case. The clock had always been a part of the shop, but Mr. Bennett had never been able to wind it, as it had not worked for decades.
