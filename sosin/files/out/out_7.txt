In the heart of a quaint town, there stood an old clock tower that had long been out of service. Its large clock face, once a symbol of punctuality, now lay still and silent, its hands frozen at midnight. The tower's bell, which used to chime every hour, was now silent, and the structure was covered in ivy and neglect.
Inside the compartment, Clara discovered an old leather-bound book and a small wooden box. The book was a journal belonging to the original clockmaker, a man named Edward Thornton. The journal detailed Edward’s work on the clock tower and his passion for horology, the study of timekeeping.

One crisp autumn morning, Clara arrived at the clock tower with a toolkit, a flashlight, and a notebook. She began by examining the exterior of the tower, noting its intricate carvings and the faded inscriptions that adorned its walls.
